Is it any visitor to the website, a registered user, an admin, or another type of user?\n2. What types of posts are users commenting on? Are these blog posts, forum threads, social media updates, or something else?\n3. Where are these posts located? On a companyâ€™s website, a social media platform, or some other context?\n4. Are there any character limits or formatting options for the comments?\n5. Should users be able to edit or delete their comments after posting?\n6. Do users need to be logged in to comment, or can this be done anonymously?\n7. Is there any moderation required for the comments (e.g., approval before posting, flagging inappropriate comments, etc.)?\n8. Will there be notifications for authors or other stakeholders when a comment is posted?\n9. Is there a requirement for threading/conversational features, such as replying to a specific comment?\n10. Does the system need to support any accessibility standards for comments?\n\nOnce I have answers to these questions, I can write tailored user stories that accurately reflect the requirements for the commenting feature.",
