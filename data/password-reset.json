Can you specify the type of users we are targeting (for example, all users, registered users, admin users, etc.)?\n2. Is there a preference for how users should verify their identity for a password reset (via email, SMS, security questions, etc.)?\n3. Should the process include CAPTCHA or any other form of bot protection?\n4. Are there certain security measures or complexity requirements for the new password the user creates?\n5. Will there be a rate limit or cooling period after a certain number of failed reset attempts?\n6. Is there a specific flow we need to follow once the user successfully resets the password (e.g., direct login, redirection to a confirmation page, etc.)?\n7. Do we need to support internationalization or localization for this feature?\n8. Should there be any special considerations for accessibility compliance?\n\nCould you provide answers to these questions?",
