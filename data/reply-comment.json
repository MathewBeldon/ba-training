Will the user be replying to comments in a public forum, private messaging, or within a different context?\n4. Are there any limitations on the length or format of the reply?\n5. Should the user be notified of replies to their comments, and if so, how?\n6. Can users reply to replies, enabling threaded conversations, or is it only one level of replies?\n7. Are there any specific actions the user can take besides just typing and posting a reply (e.g., tagging other users, attaching files, or using emojis)?\n\nOnce this information is provided, it will be possible to create appropriate user stories tailored to the epic of replying to a comment.",
