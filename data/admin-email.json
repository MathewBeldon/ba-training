Are these system admins, end-users, or another type of user?\n2. **Authentication and Authorization:** What level of authentication and authorization is required to access this endpoint? Is this endpoint available to all admins or only a subset with specific permissions?\n3. **Use Case:** What is the specific reason for adding the email field? Is it for administrative purposes, user account management, auditing, or something else?\n4. **Visibility:** Should the email field be visible to all users retrieving data from this endpoint, or only to those with certain permissions?\n5. **Format and Validation:** Is there a specific format that the email should adhere to, and should the email be validated before being returned?\n6. **Source of Data:** Where is the email data being sourced from? Is there a service or database already containing the user emails, or does this need to be integrated?\n7. **Performance and Security:** Are there any performance or security considerations we should be aware of when adding this field (e.g., data encryption, caching concerns)?\n\nOnce I have answers to these questions, I can create well-defined user stories for the implementation of this feature.",
