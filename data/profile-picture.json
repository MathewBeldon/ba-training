(e.g., are they regular users, admins, or both?)\n2. What platforms does the feature need to support? (e.g., web app, mobile app, etc.)\n3. Are there any specific image requirements or restrictions the users need to follow? (e.g., file size, dimensions, file type)\n4. Do we need to support any editing capabilities such as cropping, resizing, or rotating the image during the upload process?\n5. Should users be able to revert to a previous profile picture easily?\n6. What should happen to the previous profile picture? (e.g., is it overwritten, archived, or deleted)\n7. Are there any privacy settings concerning profile pictures that users should be able to configure? (e.g., who can see their profile picture)\n8. How important is the performance aspect, and should there be a loading indicator while the picture is being uploaded/changed?\n9. Is there any approval process needed for the profile picture before it becomes visible to others?\n10. Should there be an audit log or history tracking for profile picture changes?\n\nPlease provide this information so that I can create detailed user stories for this epic.",
