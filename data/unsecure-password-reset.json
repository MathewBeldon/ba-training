(e.g., end-users of a web application, employees within an organization, etc.)\n2. Is there a preference for the method of password recovery? (e.g., password reset link vs. sending a temporary password)\n3. Are there any existing authentication and security practices or policies to consider, such as multi-factor authentication or security questions?\n4. What are the requirements and limitations related to the content and format of the email sent to users?\n5. Do we need to include any user verification methods before sending the password or reset link to the email address?\n6. Should the user be able to initiate this process from both the web interface and a mobile app if applicable?\n7. Is there an existing user management system or service that we should integrate with for this feature?\n8. How should this process be logged or audited for security and compliance purposes?\n9. Is there any regulation or compliance standard (like GDPR, HIPAA) we need to adhere to for handling such sensitive information?\n10. What kind of notifications or feedback should be provided to the user throughout the password recovery process?\n\nOnce I have the answers to these questions, I can proceed with creating accurate and well-defined user stories for this epic.",
