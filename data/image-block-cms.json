Therefore, I have included a user story for accessibility. If it's not needed, please feel free to disregard that particular story.",

What type of users will be interacting with this 'block of images' component?\n2. Can you describe the 'block of images' in more detail? How many images are typically displayed together?\n3. Should the images be static, or will there be any interactive features such as zoom, carousels, lightbox effects, etc.?\n4. Where will this component be placed on your platform (website, mobile app, etc.), and will it be reused in multiple places?\n5. How will the images be sourced? Are they uploaded by users, selected by administrators, sourced from a CMS like Contentful, or through an API?\n6. Do we need to consider any particular image aspect ratios or resolutions?\n7. Will the block of images be paginated or infinite scroll?\n8. Are there any accessibility considerations like alt text for images or keyboard navigation?\n9. Will the users have the ability to add, remove, or edit images within the block?\n10. Do we need to track any analytics or user interactions with this component?\n\nAfter receiving this information, I can craft more accurate user stories for your epic.",
