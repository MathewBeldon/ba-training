Are we considering general app users, or are there different user roles such as guest users, registered users, trainers, or admins?\n2. Should the app provide any feedback after a workout has been favorited, such as a notification or a visual confirmation?\n3. Will users be able to view a list of their favorited workouts?\n4. Is there a limit to the number of workouts a user can favorite, or any conditions that must be met to use this feature?\n5. Will users be able to un-favorite workouts? If so, what is the expected behavior for this?\n6. Can users favorite a workout from multiple places within the app, such as a search result, their workout history, or a specific workout detailed page?\n7. Is there any social feature involved, for example, sharing a favorited workout with friends or on social media?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can create appropriate user stories for this epic.",
