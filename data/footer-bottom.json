Can you describe the type of website or application this footer will be a part of (e.g., e-commerce, informational, a web app)?\n2. What content or elements do you envision being included in the footer (e.g., contact information, navigation links, social media icons)?\n3. Should the footer be always visible at the bottom of the screen, or should it only appear at the bottom of the page content (potentially off-screen if the page content is long)?\n4. Are there any specific design or branding guidelines that need to be followed for the footer?\n5. Do you have any accessibility requirements for the footer (e.g., contrast ratios, screen reader support)?\n6. Will the footer need to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)?\n7. Are there any specific browsers or devices that the footer must be compatible with?\n8. Is there a preference for how this should be implemented (e.g., using CSS Flexbox, Grids, sticky positioning)?\n9. Do you require any animations or interactive elements in the footer (e.g., hover effects, drop-down menus)?\n10. Are there any performance considerations, such as loading times or page speed, that should be taken into account?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can create accurate and targeted user stories to ensure that the development team fully understands the scope and requirements of the feature.",
