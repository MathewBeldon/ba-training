Should the logout process require any confirmation steps, or should it be instantaneous?\n4. What should happen after the user logs out? Should they be redirected to a login page, a home page, or somewhere else?\n5. Is there any state or session information that needs to be cleared when the user logs out?\n6. Are there any security considerations or compliance requirements we should take into account when implementing this feature, such as GDPR or HIPAA?\n7. Are there any preconditions or dependencies that need to be in place for the user to have the option to log out?\n\nPlease provide answers to these questions so we can tailor the user story accordingly.",
