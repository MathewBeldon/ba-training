Can you explain the purpose behind allowing users to see other people's email addresses? What is the business rationale or user benefit for this feature?\n2. Is this feature intended for all users, or just a specific subset, such as admin users or users who have a certain level of permission?\n3. Are any privacy concerns or regulations, such as GDPR, to be taken into account when exposing personal information like email addresses?\n4. Should users have the ability to opt-in or opt-out of having their email address displayed on their profile?\n5. Is there a specific way the email address should be displayed or any security measures that should be in place to prevent misuse (e.g., obfuscation, click-to-reveal, etc.)?\n6. Are there any scenarios under which an email address should not be exposed, even if the user has opted in? For instance, in the case of suspended accounts or in certain geographic regions?\n7. How would you like the feature to be rolled out? Immediately available to all users, via a feature flag, as a part of a beta program, etc.?\n\nUpon receiving clear answers to these questions, I will be able to create appropriate user stories while upholding good practices such as protecting user privacy and complying with relevant data protection laws.",
