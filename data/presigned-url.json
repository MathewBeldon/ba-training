If there are more scenarios or specific rules that need to be addressed, additional user stories can be created accordingly.",

(e.g., general users, admins, premium users)\n2. What types of files will users be downloading? (e.g., documents, images, videos)\n3. Are there any size limits or file type restrictions for the downloads?\n4. Should the download links be temporary or permanent?\n5. Is there a need for authentication or authorization before providing the download link?\n6. Should the links be directly accessed or is a two-step process required (e.g., request link, then download)?\n7. Are there any tracking or logging requirements for the file downloads?\n8. Are there any user interface implications, such as changes to an existing web platform or app, or is this strictly about the API functionality?\n9. Should the API support batch requests for multiple files, or will it handle individual file requests only?\n10. Does the download link need to support any specific protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP)?\n11. Do you have rate limiting or concurrency concerns for the download process?\n\nOnce I have the answers to these questions, I'll be able to draft the user stories for this epic effectively, ensuring that they encapsulate all the necessary details to guide development.",
