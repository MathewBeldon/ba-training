What type of user should be able to like a comment? (e.g., any registered user, admins only, etc.)\n2. Are there any limitations on the number of likes a user can give to a single comment? (e.g., can users like a comment multiple times, or is it limited to one like per comment per user?)\n3. What happens after a user likes a comment? Should it be visually indicated that a comment has been liked by the user? (For interface feedback)\n4. Should these likes be public or anonymous? (e.g., can everyone see who liked a comment or just the total number of likes?)\n5. Are there any specific conditions under which a user cannot like a comment? (e.g., comment is locked or the user has been banned)\n6. Is there a need for a user to be able to unlike a comment after they have liked it?\n7. How do we want to handle situations with bots or inauthentic likes?\n8. Should the user receive any notification or confirmation after liking a comment?\n9. Is there a requirement to display the total number of likes a comment has received?\n10. How should the system handle rapid consecutive likes and unlikes (to prevent system abuse)?\n\nOnce I have the answers to these questions, I could create well-defined user stories that cover the necessary functionality while avoiding bad practices, such as vague requirements or undefined user roles.",
