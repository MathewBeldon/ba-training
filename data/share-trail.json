This will help me understand the context and the specific needs better, ensuring that the user stories are accurate and relevant.\n\n1. Could you specify the platform on which you want to share these walking trails (e.g., mobile app, web application)?\n2. Who are the intended users you want to share walking trails with (friends, a specific community, the general public)?\n3. Do you want to share the walking trails in real-time as you walk or after completing your walk?\n4. Should users be able to share additional information along with the trail, such as photos, descriptions, or points of interest?\n5. Will there be any privacy settings or permissions involved in sharing these trails?\n6. Is there a need for users to comment on or rate the walking trails shared by others?\n7. Do you require any form of user authentication before they can share or access the trails?\n8. What kind of notifications or alerts (if any) should be sent when a trail is shared?\n9. Should the trails be shareable on external platforms or social media?\n\nOnce I have the answers to these questions, I'll be able to draft the user stories accurately.",
