It's also crucial to validate that the implementation respects the security and privacy of user data by limiting access to the email address to the authenticated user viewing their own profile.",

Can you specify the type(s) of users who will have access to the email address through the profile endpoint? (e.g., end-users themselves, admins, support staff, etc.)\n2. Should the email address be visible to all users who can access the profile endpoint, or are there any privacy and permission considerations to account for?\n3. Will the user need to authenticate themselves to ensure that the request for the email address is secure, or is this endpoint publicly accessible?\n4. Are there any existing business rules or privacy policies that we should comply with regarding the display of a user's email address?\n5. Is there specific formatting or validation required for the email address when presented through the API?\n6. Will there be requirements for rate limiting or caching for this API endpoint to manage performance and load?\n7. Is the current system already capable of returning additional information through the profile endpoint, and is there a need to modify existing data structures or API response formats?\n8. Should the API support backward compatibility, or is it acceptable to modify the response structure for all consumers of the endpoint?\n9. Are there any additional features or related pieces of information that stakeholders anticipate will need to be added to the user's profile in the near future?\n\nOnce I have the answers to these questions, I can proceed with creating the user stories to capture the requirements.",
