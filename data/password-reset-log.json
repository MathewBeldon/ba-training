Can you specify the type of system this requirement is for (e.g., web application, mobile app)?\n2. What roles or types of users should be able to request the password reset (e.g., all users, admin users, etc.)?\n3. When you say \"log,\" what specific information do you want to be captured (e.g., timestamp, user identifier, IP address)?\n4. How should this log be stored or managed, and who should have access to it?\n5. Do you require any kind of notification or alert when a password reset is requested (e.g., email to admin)?\n6. Is there any process after logging the event that needs to be accounted for, such as verifying the user's identity before the password reset can happen?\n\nOnce I have answers to these questions, I will be able to provide more accurate user stories for your needs.",
