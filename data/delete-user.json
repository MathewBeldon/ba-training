What type of users are we considering for this feature? Are we referring to all users or specific types, such as end-users, admins, etc.?\n2. Are there any legal or regulatory requirements we must consider when implementing account deletion (e.g., GDPR's \"Right to be Forgotten\")?\n3. Should the user experience be immediate deletion, or is there a grace period during which users can recover their account?\n4. What should happen with the user's data after they delete their account? Should the data be anonymized, archived, or permanently deleted immediately?\n5. Are there any dependencies or subscriptions related to the user that need to be considered before deletion?\n6. Is there a verification process to ensure that the person requesting the deletion is indeed the account owner?\n7. Do we need to inform the user of any consequences of deleting an account, such as loss of access to content or services?\n8. Should we provide a feedback form or exit survey to understand why they are deleting their account?\n9. What kind of confirmation (email, notification) should users receive after they have deleted their account?\n10. Are there any other systems or third-party services that need to be notified of the account deletion?\n\nOnce I receive answers to these questions, I can create user stories that capture the requirements accurately.",
