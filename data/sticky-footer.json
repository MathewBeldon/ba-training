What types of users will be interacting with the sticky footer? (e.g., general website visitors, registered users, admins)\n2. What specific information or features should be included in the sticky footer? (e.g., contact information, links to privacy policy, social media icons)\n3. Are there any specific actions users should be able to perform using the sticky footer?\n4. Should the sticky footer be visible across all pages of the website?\n5. Are there any responsive design considerations for the sticky footer on different devices or screen sizes?\n6. Are there any particular aesthetic or branding guidelines the sticky footer design should adhere to?\n7. Is there specific content that should not be obscured by the sticky footer on scrollable pages?\n\nOnce I have answers to these questions, I can create user stories that accurately reflect the requirements for the sticky footer epic.",
